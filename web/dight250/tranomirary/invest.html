				<h3>Why Trano Mirary?</h3>
				<p>	We don’t just build quality affordable housing; Trano Mirary builds communities that foster an upwardly mobile society that allows people to move out of poverty and into a much important “middle class.”</p>

				<h3>Why Madagascar?</h3>
				<p>Currently Madagascar has almost entirely a two-class system divided into the 99% and the 1%. The inability to progress has lead to social stagnation in Madagascar. This has resulted with little opportunity for innovation and in a nation of persons who feel disenfranchised from the benefit of social and political participation. Trano Mirary is starting to change this by providing the poor with the opportunities of home ownership and ready access to education and healthcare that has been traditionally reserved for the top 1%.</p>

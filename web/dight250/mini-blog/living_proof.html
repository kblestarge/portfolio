				<p><span>Neil Harbisson:</span><br>best known for being the first person in the world with an antenna implanted in his skull. His antenna allows him to perceive visible and invisible colours such as infrareds and ultraviolets via audible vibrations in his skull as well as receive images, videos, music or phone calls directly into his head. His wifi enabled antenna also allows him to receive colours from satellites and hear extraterrestrial colours from space.

				<p><span>Professor Steve Mann:</span><br> He designed a headset that is outfitted with a number of small computers and through it, he can record and play video and audio. He was one of the, if not the first, cyborgs in the world.

				<p><span>Dr. Kevin Warwick:</span><br> He is a cybernetics professor in the UK’s University of Reading. He has experimented with different electronic implants since 1998 such as installing a microchip in his arm which lets him operate lights, heaters, computers and lights remotely. He and his work have become one. He is the founder of Project Cyborg using himself as the guinea pig, he’s on a mission to become the world’s most complete cyborg.

				<p><span>Jesse Sullivan:</span><br> He became a cyborg when he got equipped with a bionic limb, which was connected through nerve-muscle grafting. Aside from having control over his limb with his mind, he can also feel temperature as well as how much pressure his grip applies.

				<p><span>Jens Naumann:</span><br> After a pair of horrific accidents, Jens Naumann was struck blind in both eyes, but he never gave up hope that he would someday see again. That dream became a reality when, in 2002, Naumann became the first person in the world to receive an artificial vision system. His electronic eye is connected directly to his visual cortex through brain implants. Unlike with other cyborg implants, which translate visual information into another sense such as sound or touch, Naumann actually "sees" the world. Though it has its limits (he can only vaguely see lines and shapes), his vision has been technically restored.
